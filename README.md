# Human_Memory_Decoding

For the publication of our Human Memory Decoding Paper

**Author:** Xiwei She, PhD

## **Overview**

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for training a double-layer multi-resolution memory decoding model. 
To reproduce the results and plots presented in the manuscript, start with the script named `MD_0_1_dataProcessing.m` and run through all scripts in order based on their naming indices. 

All necessary functional scripts are stored in the folder named `toolbox`.

All intermediate result files will be **automatically** saved in the `processedData` and `result` folders once you finish running the corresponding scripts in the main directory.

To help readers better understand the model's methodologies, an example dataset is provided in the `exampleData` folder.

## **Important Notes**

- The provided example dataset has been fully de-identified for ethical reasons.
- This dataset is intended solely for the purpose of checking and understanding the model's methodologies, as well as reproducing the results.
- Please **do not** distribute this data without explicit permission from the authors.
- Full dataset of this human memory decoding project are available upon request.
