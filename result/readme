This folder contains all intermediate result files generated by the model.

We provide referenced result files, which are generated after the two layers of modeling and global model selection steps, in the package named "result (reference).zip". 

Readers can unpack this file and directly check the results using the visualization scripts named:
MD_2_3_resultsVisualizationViolinPentagon.m
MD_3_1_SCFM_calculation.m
MD_3_2_SCFM_Classification.m

These referenced results should match the output once the reader has completed all the modeling steps, specifically from MD_0_1_dataProcessing to MD_2_1_runMetalearner.
